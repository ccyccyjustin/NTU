<ins>Setup</ins>

Please have anaconda installed (```https://www.anaconda.com/download```).  

Packages required: ```arch, CIBer, scikit-plot, tensorflow```. All can be installed through pip.

If importing ```tensorflow``` raises error, you might want to uninstall it and install it through conda instead.

If it still does not work, you may need to create a new virtual environment and install it there.
